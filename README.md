**Week 4**

* Action-item:Update your webpages to display static data from a Javascript file, instead of the data being hardcoded in the HTML file *

**Steps**
* - Defined an array of object to store static data for each hero character

- Used querySelector to select the element where the data should be rendered

- Utilized the map() function to generate hero cards dynamically

- Continued with the styles that was used in the previous task
