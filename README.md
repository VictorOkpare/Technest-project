**Month 3 Week 3**
Action Item 1: Write uniit and or integration tests for your project using Jest or a similar testing framework!

I performed unit testing on the searchbar component for the following scenerios
 - *Rendering Test*: Verifies that the search bar is rendered with the correct elements (input, filter button, and clear button)

 - *Input Event Test*: Ensures that the onSearch callback is called with the correct search term and category when the input changes

 - *Filter toggle Test*: Checks that the search category cycles correctly and updates the placeholder text when the filter button is clicked

 - *Clear Button Test*: Verifies that the search input is cleared and the clear button is disabled when the clear button is clicked.

 - *Clear Button State Test*: Ensures that the clear button is enabled /disabled based on whether the input has a value.


 Action Item 2: Write end-to-end user tests for your project: 

 I performed functional and user experience testing on the search bar feature of my project. Here is the [Test Script](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vll2ZoW1YdLE4vjhw76oA3FrzB9D3rePY8M98WxD44/edit?usp=sharing) it contains all test cases that was covered in this test.

 General Improvements: 
 *UI Revamp*- A New look for the UI of my project, improved responsive design on big screens and mobile screens . 
 *Dark mode and Light mode themes*- The project now has a theme button tha allows users to toggle between dark mode and light mode![UI-Revamp](./Assignments/assets/media/uioptimization.gif)


 *Renamed Project Title* for better SEO

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository 
2. Navigate to the technest folder and run the command *npm install* to load the necessary dependencies on the project.





**Month 3 Week 2**

Action Item 1: Add Pagination Functionality


This week I  continued with the implementation of pagination with Back and Next buttons to navigate through the card data. It also uses numbered pagination (e.g., 1 2 ... 10) for easy navigation between pages.

Pagination works for both filtered (search results) and unfiltered data.

Users can now view a limited number of cards per page (CARDS_PER_PAGE = 9), improving performance and user experience.



- The updatePaginationControls() function dynamically generates pagination buttons based on the current page and total pages.

- The changePage() function handles page navigation and re-renders the cards for the selected page.

Action Item 2: Jump-to-Page Functionality


I added a *Jump to Page* feature, allowing users to input a specific page number and navigate directly to it.

Input validation ensures users enter a valid page number within the available range.

Technical Details:

The jumpToInput and jumpToButton elements handle the jump-to-page functionality.

The jumpToButton event listener validates the input and calls changePage() to render the selected page.

Action Item 3: Infinite Scroll (Optional)
Whatâ€™s New:

I implemented a Load More button to dynamically append additional cards to the current view, simulating a controlled infinite scroll.

This feature is available for mobile display.

Technical Details:

The loadMoreButton event listener increments the currentPage and appends new cards to the existing view using the renderCards() function with the append parameter set to true.

**Month 3 Week 1**
Action item 1: Add functionality to search and filter your webpage with multiple characters. You decide whether you want to use local data or fetched data from an API, and how "smart" you want your search functionality to be - i.e., exact name matching ("firstName lastName"), partial name matching ("firstNa"), case sensitivity ("firstname lastname"), wildcard or pattern support ("first*", "f?rst"), fuzzy searching (find results even when the search query contains slight variations or misspellings), etc.

- This week, I implemented search and filter functionality in my project. Given the large dataset available through the API call to https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php, I optimized the fetch request by limiting the response to cards with the archetype "Elemental HERO." The modified API call is: https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php?archetype=Elemental%20HERO. This ensures more efficient data retrieval and better performance.

- The search functionality allows users to search by different category, Using the filter button to set the input field to the category the user would like to search by.
The *handleSearch* function takes two argument, which is the search term and the category e.g("searchquery", "attribute" ).It uses Fuse.js, a fuzzy search library, to perform the search.

- Action Item 2: Add functionality to reset the data and display all the characters once more. You decide how it looks - e.g., reset button, clear search bar, etc.

- I added a clear button in th searchbar.js which is a reusable module in my project. When the clear button is clicked it calls the *clearSearch* method, which sets the value of the input field to an empty string which will call the *onSearch* method which resets the *filteredCard* to *allcard*. 


General Improvements
- I corrected the stretched image in the modal cards 
- I included an online notification
- I implemented eventlisteners to close the modal when you click outside the modal or use the escape key.
- Added more exceptions handling
- Cached image data into indexDB to limit number of API call and improve offline functionality (not fully implemented yet due to CORS restrictions from the API)

**Month 2-Week 2**

Action item 1: Fetch data from an API and dynamically render UI.

- I continued with the Yu-gi-oh cards and got this api endpoint https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php to fetch data for my cards.
- I also decided to set up a modal to display card details for each character card clicked

Action item 2: Expand error handling on your web page(s). Consider the user experience for such cases as data fetching failures, lost network connection, etc.

- I learnt how to handle exceptions for when there is a lost of connection so i included a simple error message for that.
- I also caught exceptions for invalid data and when a data is not available, or for an invalid fetch.

**General Improvements**

-Improved structure and maintainability of code
-Integrated card modal functionality and improved profile detail card handling
-Refactor CSS for enhanced styling and responsiveness

**Month 2-Week 1 **
 Action Items 1: Update your webpages to dynamically render UI from a JSON file .

 Here are the steps i took to dynamically render data from the Json file.

* - I Created a folder "data" in my assets folder to store static data
  - I converted the herodetails array of the Week4 task to  Json data and created the heroDetails.json file
  - I defined an async function to fetch data from the json file which returned a promise
  - I created heroDetails variable to hold the fetchData() function
  - I converted the createHeroCards() and profileHerocard() functions to async function because heroDetails  now returns a promise and needs to be resolved first.


  Action item 2 (Optional) - Add error handling to your web page(s). Consider the user experience for such cases as an invalid file path, empty data, invalid data, etc.

  Errors handled

- Fetch fuction data errors: I used the try catch block in the execution of the fetch data function to catch errors that may occur in fetching the data like an incorrect file path or if the .json()method encounters an invalid JSON data. it would fail so the catch block will also catch this error and display an error in the console and also send an error message on the HTML container

- Empty Data Error: If I have an empty array the if statement in my try block will run and will display an erro message in my HTML container.

- Index Error: In my profilecard section I handled errors that could occur from the heroIndex. The heroIndex is assigned to every card when the heroDetails is been mapped through from the json data. This index is used in the profilecard section to match the heroCard that was clicked and the data of the hero in the heroDetails then the data is rendered on the Hero Profile Card. I used the try-catch block to check if the heroIndex is valid, and for every invalid heroIndex I return an message to the HTML container





**Week 4**

* Action-item:Update your webpages to display static data from a Javascript file, instead of the data being hardcoded in the HTML file *

**Steps**
* - Defined an array of object to store static data for each hero character

- Used querySelector to select the element where the data should be rendered

- Utilized the map() function to generate hero cards dynamically

- Used the URLSearchParams to retrieve the Hero index from the Hero card page

- Utilized the parseInt() to ensure the index passed is an integer data type

- Continued with the styles that was used in the previous task


Here is a demo
